## The Numbers Game

For the past 4 months I have been looking for a job as a junior web developer and, although I have not achieved my goal, I have learned a lot about this industry in the process. Failure has forced me to take a long hard look at myself and diagnose my weaknesses. After numerous rejections, I have made some conclusions about the state of the industry and also about the actions I need to take in order to break in. Failure is demoralizing but only if you don't learn anything from it. With the right attitude, a 'no' from a company can be an amazing learning experience and could make you a better developer in the long run. Ultimately looking for a job is a numbers game. The advice I keep receiving: apply to hundreds of jobs expecting rejection each time and eventually someone will say yes.

## The Junior Developer Catch-22

Bad news first. Every tech company wants to hire developers with years of experience and they often turn their noses up at junior developers. Once a company finds out I lack the years of experience, I usually get a nicely worded email telling me that I was a strong candidate but 'unfortunately they are looking for someone with real-world experience'. So the big question is: how do you get the job without experience when you need experience to get the job? I call this no-win situation 'Web Developer Purgatory' because while you might have the necessary skills and passion, companies will favor candidates who already have years of experience in the industry. In this culture of short-term profit seeking, investing in junior developers is considered a drain and a liability. The lack of mentorship and cultivation of new talent is bad for industry culture in the long-run because it creates an atmosphere of exclusion. And companies are losing out on high-potential talent solely because of an unwillingness to train them. The situation becomes more dire when you factor in the bootcamp bubble that is pumping out a tidal wave of junior developers all competing for the shrinking pool of junior positions.

## I haven't failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.

After accepting the unfortunate reality of the state of the industry, what actions can we take to improve our chances of landing the job? That's a question I ask myself every day. 'Failure' helps me because I learn the actions I must take to become a more attractive candidate. A 'no' from a company forces me to look at my weaknesses and take action to improve those weak areas.

### Learn Algorithms

I had a phone interview for a full-stack position that started off as a casual conversation. The conversation went great until the interviewer asked me to do a 30-minute live-coding session to solve an algorithm. Solving an algorithm while on the phone, with the interviewer watching everything I was doing, was a harrowing experience. Developers have ranted against this [broken interview tactic](https://theoutline.com/post/1166/programmers-are-confessing-their-coding-sins-to-protest-a-broken-job-interview-process?zd=1&zi=eix2fcfp) for a while now but the industry still seems to value on-the-spot performance. To make a long story short, I bombed the coding challenge and basically just froze up. I have solved much more complicated problems but I just could not handle the pressure in that moment.

This industry is filled with unfortunate realities and white boarding is one of those realities. After accepting this reality I began aggressively practicing algorithms. [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) and [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) are two good options for training yourself to build up confidence in solving problems. I've spent the last few months on HackerRank, solving algorithms in four languages (PHP, Python, Ruby and JavaScript). This process trains fluency in multiple languages and reduces the anxiety I feel around white-boarding. Even if the company you are interested in doesn't care about white-boarding, practicing algorithms will give you a confidence boost. I recently had another algorithm-based interview that went exceptionally well thanks to loads of practice and prior failures.

### Prepare for Interviews

I consider myself a people person and I enjoy spontaneous conversation. Historically, I have avoided interview preparation and have relied heavily on my ability to improvise. After enough interviews, I have learned that certain questions get asked over and over again. For example, companies keep asking me this question: "What were you doing before you became a developer?". Because of lack of preparation, my answer was usually scattered and superfluous.

Write down the essential components of your developer story and keep it simple. People don't want to hear you talk about your story for 10 minutes. Writing things down helps a lot. This way you have a small script in the back of your head you can pull out when you get asked this question. Interviewing is a skill. Like any skill it requires practice and ideally you can get that practice in before you actually sit down for the interview. There are meetups dedicated specifically to interview preparation that provide much-needed practice. I've also learned that interviewers respect you when you say, "I don't know". They prefer "I don't know" over a bullshit answer you gave because your ego couldn't admit that you don't know something.

### Give Your Portfolio Site Love

Without experience it is important to have a body of work that showcases your skills as a developer. My old portfolio site was a dusty relic that needed to be torn down and rebuilt. Not only was it old and unmaintained, I was using a theme. I remember talking to a client for a freelance project and the client telling me my old personal website wasn't that impressive.

I built this current site in Gatsby.js and I have spent a good amount of time giving it love. A personal website is a direct reflection of who you are as a developer and it's usually the first thing companies see when they google you. Constant maintenance and attention of your portfolio site is very important. Don't let years pass before changing things up.

### Practice Self-Discipline

There is no sugar-coating it. Not landing that exciting job sucks. You can either learn from a failure or let it own you. Be especially careful of using substances to cope with the emotional roller coaster that is the job hunt. It is so important to remain strong in the face of failure and so easy to fall down a rabbit hole of self-pity and despair. Stay connected with family, friends and get advice from people in the industry. Isolation is a one-way ticket to misery.

## Ascension Into Developer Heaven

Web Development is my passion and nothing will stop me from achieving my dream of becoming a professional developer. The industry has been cold to this newcomer but it has also forced me to take a long hard look in the mirror. After accepting the harsh reality that this industry is unfriendly to the newcomer, I can begin to take actions that bring me closer and closer to success. And I will get there. But for now I find myself staring up at heaven from my spot in purgatory waiting for my day to come.
