I am a **passionate** web developer based in New York City. In 2017, I graduated from the Flatiron School in NYC with a strong foundation in functional and object-oriented programming. I know multiple frameworks and languages, including Ruby, Python, Javascript and PHP. I love learning new technologies and enjoy adapting to shifts in the industry. My developer ethos: always be learning and always be coding.
